On the one hand, the computer science contents are ranging from basic informatics to UI/UX design to data analysis. On the other hand, the medial courses such as photography, video and graphics offer a broad media insight and round off the study. My final thesis \"Interaktive Visualisierung und Verknüpfung von Sportdaten am Beispiel der Formel 1\" visualizes all drivers of the formula 1 and their achievements, you can see the result in the link below.",
